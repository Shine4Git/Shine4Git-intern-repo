Research & Learn
- Key roles in an Agile team:
  - Developers who work on the core functions and performance of the product.
  - QA who tests and verifies that the product meets requirements.
  - PM who manages the product and ensures that it is progressing.
  - Agile PM who manages the product's change and communication between different parts of the team.
  - Other supporting roles who provide different things depending on the product requirements such as gathering requirements, communicating with customers, addressing concerns and providing support.
- In Kanban these roles will collaborate and communicate to meet requirements, minimise delivery time and maximise efficiency whereas in Scrum these roles will be more structured and streamlined, working towards a shared goal.

Reflection
- My role is in cybersecurity and it contributes to the Agile process by ensuring that the app and confidential information around it is kept secure which will reduce disruption to the process, improves customer satisfaction and addresses their concerns.
- My responsibilities overlap and interact with developers and QA as by collaborating with those teams and practicing secure coding it will improve the security of the app. My role also interacts with PMs and other supporting roles to determine and understand requirements and communicate with customers.
