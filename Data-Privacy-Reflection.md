Reflection
- To ensure secure data handling in daily tasks I can minimise my handling and only do so when required. I should only access confidential data when I have checked my device and network is secure.
- To safely store and share sensitive information safely it should be encrypted during storage and sharing, anonymised if possible. Disposal should be done either through verified services or thorough processes which may involve wiping or physical destruction of storage mediums.
- Some common mistakes that may lead to data privacy issues is using outdated encryption, software or other security measures, poor employee awareness and insecure handling. These may be avoided with automated updates, employee training and regular checks and audits of data handling.
