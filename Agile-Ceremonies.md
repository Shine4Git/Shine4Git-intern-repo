Research & Learn
- Agile ceremonies:
  - Daily Stand-ups to communicate progress and address issues.
  - Sprint Planning vs Continuous Prioritisation to decide upcoming tasks and their priority.
  - Retrospectives to review and reflect for future work cycles.
  - Backlog Refinement to review backlog tasks and determine if any changes are required.
- Agile teams can collaborate asynchronously and across time zones through asynchronous communication channels and shared/centralised project information.

Reflection
- Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment by keeping relevant parties aware of each other's and overall progress which keeps members focused on their responsibilities.
- Daily stand-ups are most important for my role as security concerns can change quickly and require fast responses.

Tasks
- I attended daily stand-ups for the data analyst, cybersecurity and web developer teams on Mondays to Fridays at 2pm. Members present were asked for updates on their situation and any problems they were having, if there are then there was some discussion about direction and solutions.
- I joined the weekly retrospective for my role and went over my hours and what I had accomplished. I also went over any blockers that hindered my progress and gave feedback and improvements to help with that.
- One change I could make to improve collaboration would be asynchronously contacting team members outside of the daily stand-up when working together.
