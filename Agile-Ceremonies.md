Research & Learn
- Agile ceremonies:
  - Daily Stand-ups to communicate progress and address issues.
  - Sprint Planning vs Continuous Prioritisation to decide upcoming tasks and their priority.
  - Retrospectives to review and reflect for future work cycles.
  - Backlog Refinement to review backlog tasks and determine if any changes are required.
- Agile teams can collaborate asynchronously and across time zones through asynchronous communication channels and shared/centralised project information.

Reflection
- Agile ceremonies help with communication and alignment by keeping relevant parties aware of each other's and overall progress which keeps members focused on their responsibilities.
- Daily stand-ups are most important for my role as security concerns can change quickly and require fast responses.
