Research & Learn
- AI tools see use in endpoint, network and cloud security and detection to collect and analyse security data. It is also used in IAM to create user activity profiles and in incident response to improve response times and effectiveness.
- In a professional setting AI use may improve productivity and work effectiveness. Risks of AI use would be data leaks, inaccurate or incorrect implementations and skill atrophy.
- Confidential information should never be entered into AI tools as the AI collects this information into its dataset thus constituting data leaking.
- To validate and ensure accuracy when working with AI-generated content have the AI explain and break down the processes it went through to generate the content, then go through the processes yourself and try to recreate it.

Reflection
- Consider AI use for tedious or time-consuming tasks which you are confident in doing yourself and can verify the accuracy of the AI results. If one cannot confidently verify the accuracy of the AI's output, then it would be better to rely on one's own skills.
- To avoid over-reliance on AI yet still benefit, it would be best to prioritise doing tasks yourself and slowly allow the AI to handle time-consuming tasks that you are confident in checking the AI's accuracy.
- To ensure data privacy when using AI tools do not enter confidential information into the AI, consider making efforts to anonymising the information to further ensure data privacy.
