Research & Learn
- A Kanban board works by visually presenting tasks and showing the progress of them, it helps manage workflow as it centralises and quickly communicates information on task progress.
- Different columns on a Kanban board represent the progress of tasks depending on where they are placed, either not in progress, in progress, stopped due to various reasons such as an obstacle or completed.
- Tasks are moved through the board by the team working on them, either individual team members assigned to the tasks move them as they progress or it is reported to the team leader/PM who moves the tasks.
- Limiting WIP is beneficial as it keeps the team focused on a small set of tasks and minimises the risk of confusion or potential duplicating work thus improving efficiency.

Reflection
- Kanban helps manage priorities and avoid overload by clearly communicating tasks and what is being worked on keeping things focused.
- I can improve my workflow using Kanban principles as it will help define my tasks and their progress.
