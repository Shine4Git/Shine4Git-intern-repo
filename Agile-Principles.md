Research & Learn
- Agile is a project management framework that differs from traditional project management by breaking large projects down into smaller cycles and iterative working to progress, it allows more adaptability and flexibility for projects.
- The core values of Agile are:
  - Individuals and interactions over processes and tools
  - Working software over comprehensive documentation
  - Customer collaboration over contract negotiation
  - Responding to change over following a plan

  The principles of Agile are early customer satisfaction, continuous delivery, welcoming changing requirements, collaborative working between all parts of the organisation and reflection.
- Scrum has fixed length sprints and defined roles whereas Kanban focuses on maximising efficiency and limiting work in progress. Scrum may be more suitable when work is predictable and can be planned out while Kanban may be better when work is dependent on emerging factors and requires better adaptability.
- Focus Bear leans towards Kanban as the app is continuously being developed and may be changed based on changing factors in technology, market, users and their feedback.

Reflection
- The biggest benefits of Agile would be adaptability and flexibility, it is very advantageous to quickly meet new requirements and introduce changes. The biggest challenges would be resistance to changes and communicating changes to all the relevant parties.
- Agile principles can help improve my role and responsibilities as I will need to respond to and implement controls on changing the app's changing security needs thus being adaptable will be beneficial.
