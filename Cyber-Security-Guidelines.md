- Common cybersecurity threats in a remote work environment are phishing attacks and data or credential theft via insecure networks or devices.
- Best practices for securing devices and accounts would be using strong passwords ideally in combination with password managers, 2FA or passkeys.
- It is important to lock your computer when away from your desk to prevent the risk of unauthorised access to confidential information from physical threat actors.
- Phishing attempts and suspicious links should be handled by reporting them to your superiors oor the relecant teams. Do not engage or attempt to investigate without authorisation to prevent the risk of damage.
- A strong password is lengthy and complex using upper and lower case characters, numbers and symbols. A password manager is recommended as strong passwords are difficult to remember for most people, the password manager is capable of generating strong passwords and storing them securely so that the user only needs to remember the password manager's password to access their other passwords.
- 2FA is important as it introduces additional layers of security for for accessing accounts. As credentials may be stolen or lost 2FA seeks to verify the accessor's identity by further checks, usually something they know (email), have (sms) or are (biometrics).

- I lock my devices when away from them, do not respond to phishing attempts, use strong passwords avoiding reuse and use 2FA. I could improve by making use of a password manager.
- To create habits around secure behaviour one should make efforts to check their behaviour and evaluate whether it is improving their security, staying aware and thinking about how secure their information is helps with forming the habits.
- Use complex passwords, 2FA and password managers. Avoid credential reuse and insecure networks, stay aware of phishing attempts.
- Report the incident to the cybersecurity teams so that the account may be quarantined and investigated.
