Research & Learn
- Vulnerable populations are people who are at higher risk compared to the overall population, some of these include children and elderly, people with disability or neurodivergent conditions and racial, sexual, gender minorities. In the digital space they might face increased difficulties with completing tasks they want to do or are required of them and experience difficulty with seeking help they may require.
- When designing for or working with neurodivergent individuals some ethical considerations are important to ensure the experience of the user is accommodating. Avoid overwhelming the user with information (including visual and auditory), communicate information clearly to ensure understanding, allow some degree of freedom for users to control settings or other parts of the app.
- Interactions and content can be made more accessible for people with ADHD or autism by using clear, simple language, keeping navigation and use predictable and familiar and reducing cognitive load by limiting the amount of information that is presented to the user at any time.
- In a professional setting neurodivergent team members can be supported by being clear in communication to avoid confusion, being respectful of each other's working styles and habits and being accommodating and flexible when working with them.

Reflection
- Adjusting my communication style to be clearer can make it more inclusive for neurodivergent users and teammates.
- Common UX or communication pitfalls that might make Focus Bear less accessible or supportive would be things such as overwhelming information or unclear or confusing communication.
- One practical change I can make in my work to better support vulnerable populations would be communicating in a clear and concise manner with others to ensure understanding and minimise confusion.
