Research & Learn
- Some risks of using a laptop without an external monitor or keyboard would be poor posture, neck strain and wrist discomfort leading to discomfort causing difficulties with working and potential long-term damage.
- Ergonomic equipment can be used to improve posture when working on laptop, things like laptop stands, external displays, keyboards and mice, ergonomic chairs, mice or mousepads.
- Monitor height, chair position, and desk setup should be adjusted to reduce neck strain and improve posture, doing so makes for a healthier workspace.
- Daily habits such as taking breaks to move around, practice eye strain reduction techniques and regular posture checks can reduce the impact of prolonged laptop use.

Reflection
- I could improve my workspace setup by using an external monitor, a laptop stand or a chair with a greater range of adjustment.
- Some behavioural changes I could implement to improve posture and reduce strain would be taking regular breaks and practicing eye strain reduction techniques.
- Apps like Focus Bear can be used for setting up ongoing and regular reminders to maintain good posture and take breaks.

Tasks
- I tried adjusting my chair height and monitor so that my posture and the angle of my head were more ergonomic which should reduce discomfort and the risk of injury.
- I tried using reminder tools for posture and movement and found there was some benefit to reducing discomfort.
